This repository contains the slides for the talk I gave at SciPy 2013 entitled,
"Why you should write buggy software with as few features as possible.". This talk is a 
summary of some blog posts that I wrote on the topics of features and scope in early 2013:

* [Features and Scope in Open Source Software](http://brianegranger.com/?p=249)
* [Personal Reflections on Features and Scope](http://brianegranger.com/?p=261)

Here is a rendered version of the [slides](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/ellisonbg/talk-scipy2013/master/FeaturesAndScope.ipynb)

Cheers,
